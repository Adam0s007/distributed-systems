## To get started with the application, follow these simple steps:

- Step 1: Begin by running the Main class. This action will start the server and prepare it to accept connections.
- Step 2: After the server is up and running, you can connect multiple clients. To do this, execute the ClientApp for each client you wish to connect.

You can launch ClientApp multiple times, depending on the number of clients you need to connect.
